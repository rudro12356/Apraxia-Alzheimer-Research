## 📝 Introduction
This project is designed for **motion analysis in Apraxia and Alzheimer’s research**. It processes **video data** of patients performing predefined actions, extracts **skeleton joints**, and stores them for further analysis. The extracted skeleton data can be used for **gesture classification**, **anomaly detection**, and **movement analysis**.

## ✨ Features
✅ **Extracts human pose landmarks** using **MediaPipe Pose**  
✅ **Processes medical video datasets** to analyze movement patterns  
✅ **Outputs structured CSV files** containing skeleton joint positions  
✅ **Supports batch processing** for multiple patients  
✅ **Automated Video-to-Skeleton Pipeline**
